<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Intake Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Type</li><li>Dry Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engine intake filter market comprises two main types: wet and dry. Wet-type filters use oil to trap contaminants, offering high efficiency and durability, ideal for heavy-duty or dusty environments. Dry-type filters rely on pleated paper or fabric media, providing low maintenance and cost-effectiveness, suitable for standard automotive and industrial applications. Both types aim to protect engines by filtering air, but wet filters excel in harsh conditions, while dry filters are preferred for their simplicity and ease of replacement.</p></p>

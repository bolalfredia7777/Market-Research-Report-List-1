<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Digestion Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mesophilic Digestion</li><li>Thermophilic Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaerobic digestion plants are classified into two main types based on temperature: mesophilic and thermophilic digestion. Mesophilic digestion typically operates at temperatures between 30°C and 40°C, favoring the growth of specific bacteria that effectively break down organic matter, producing biogas efficiently. In contrast, thermophilic digestion functions at higher temperatures, around 50°C to 60°C, which accelerates organic matter decomposition and enhances biogas yield but requires more energy and careful management of operating conditions. Both systems are vital for renewable energy production and waste management.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Migratory Antistats</li><li>Non-Migratory Antistats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market is categorized into two main types: migratory antistats and non-migratory antistats. Migratory antistats are additives that move to the surface of a polymer, enhancing its conductivity over time but may diminish effectiveness with environmental exposure. Non-migratory antistats, on the other hand, remain within the polymer matrix, providing long-lasting anti-static properties without leaching out. Both types cater to various applications in industries like packaging, electronics, and textiles, ensuring effective static control during processing and use.</p></p>
